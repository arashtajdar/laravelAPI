## About the project

- Sanctum for Auth
- Laravel collections to display the result in better way
- Faker and factory for feature tests
- feature tests can be extended, but I think that is enough for now. let me know if you want me to extend it and write more deep tests.
- I wrote some annotations to document my lines, also I wrote some comment for documentations. I think those are enough because the other parts of my code are clearly readable, but this one also can be extended :)
- I added category table, and it's relation to product table just to show how I use relations in migration file and in models and controllers. I can also extend it and create new tables.
- Docker implemented. It was better and easier to use sail, but I prefer to create the Dockerfile by myself.
- Docker and related files need many improvements (needs some more time), but it is good for now.
